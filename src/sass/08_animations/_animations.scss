// This file covers anything that relates to amimation. So if animation has an
// effect on layout we can bury it in here, and know that if the browser doesn't
// support it, we'll naturally fall back to the original column layout. This
// relies on the modernizr check for animation/transition support, so we also
// know that we have JS support. Of course if something goes wrong between the
// modernizr call and the JS animation scripts, we're in trouble, but there's
// not much to be done about that, I think.

// TODO: divide out animations from transitions?

// TODO: clean this file down some, remove keyframe definitions we don't use
